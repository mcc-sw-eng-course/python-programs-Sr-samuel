Testing Metrics
=====

### Why Measure? 

Metrics are the means by which the software quality can be measured. If an organization wishes to improve its level of software development in any area, It must know where it is, and it must know where it wants to go.

### What to Measure? 

Some Metrics to measure are:

- Defects/ KLOC or FP
- Defect Finding Rate
- Defect Severity
- Number of Defects
- Time to Fix a Defect

### Metric Analysis

Much as the time is spent gathering or maintaining test metrics, enough time should be spent to review and interpret on a regular basis throughout the test effort. It is important to look at several metrics, as this will allow the project team to have a more complete picture of what took place during a test.

The metrics provided by testing offer a major benefit to executives: visibility into the maturity and readiness for release or production, and visibility into the quality of the software product under development. This enables effective management of the software development process, by allowing clear measurement of the quality and completeness of the product.
