Effective Software Defect Tracking
=====

What is a Defect?
-----

Failure to conform to specifications.

Another definition of defect: variance from a desired attribute. These attributes include complete and correct requirements and specifications, designs that meet requirements, and programs that observe requirements and business rules.


Implementing an Effective Defect Tracking Process
-----

Effective defect tracking begins with a systematic process. A structured tracking process begins with initially logging the defects, investigating the defects, then providing the structure to resolve them.

Defect tracking must be implemented throughout the development lifecycle.

Phases of Defect Tracking
-----

1. Requirements: Validate that the defined requirements meet the needs and the user expectations.
2. Design and Analysis: Identifying and documenting that the application design meets the user requirements.
3. Programming: Ensuring that the programs accomplish the defined application functionality given by the requirements and design.
4. Maintenance and Enhancement: Track ongoing user issues with the software, even after enhancements.

An Effective Defect Tracking Process

### Defect Repository

Once discovered the the defect must be stored in a database, well described to be easily reproducible while debugging.

Attributes of defects:

- Number
- Date
- Build and test platform
- Application requirement which relates
- Any Supplementary notes

### Defect Description

The description should be well detailed, not merely "Window does not work."

### Defect Priority

In order to resolve a defect, it must be properly analyzed and prioritized according to it's severity.

- Resolve Immediately
- High Priority
- Normal Queue
- Low Priority

### Structured resolution

The defect tracking system also must ensure that the defect progresses in an appropriate sequence from discovery through resolution.

### Communication

An effective defect tracking system must allow communication of the software's defects, status, or changes to members of the development team and all others concerned.

### Continuos Defect Resolution

Divided the project into smaller deliverables and implemented defect tracking for each deliverable. If resolution were to be delayed until later, the mere complexity of the various deliverables would present an inordinate amount of challenge to resolve defects.

### Defect Evaluation and Analysis

Define measures and constantly measure them in order to evaluate the performance. This key practice is especially critical in defect removal.

- Defect Evaluation.
  - Although the evaluation of test coverage provides the measure of testing completion, an evaluation of defects discovered during testing provides the best indication of software quality.
- Defect Analysis. 
  - This means analyzing the distribution of defects over the values of one or more parameters associated with a defect. Defect analysis provides an indication of the reliability of the software. (Status, Priority, Severity, Source)

### Defect Reporting

Defect evaluation and analysis have to be reported in a useful form to those who make decisions about resources, costs, and delivery schedules.

Classes of Reports:
- Defect density or distribution report: Count of defects in function of their severity.
- Defect age reports: How long a defect has been in it's status (Open, etc.)
- Defect trend reports: Count by status as a function of time.

Conclusion
-----

By facilitating discovery of defects earlier in the development cycle, effective defect tracking is a critical key to lower costs, enhanced software quality, and reducing overall project cost. However, to achieve this requires a fundamental change in the ideology behind quality assurance and the software development process as well as the introduction of the necessary tools to track and manage defects.
