Ch. 4 - Design by Contract
-----

Use the same concept of contract: A contract defines your rights and responsibilities, as well as those of the other party, in Software Design.

Every function and method in a software system does something. DBC  is a simple yet powerful technique that focuses on documenting (and agreeing to) the rights and responsibilities of software modules to ensure program correctness.

Meyer describes these expectations and claims as follows:

- Pre-Conditions
  -  the routineâ€™s requirements.
- Post-Conditions
  - the state of the world when the routine is done.
- Class invariants
  - Ensures that this condition is always true from the perspective of a caller.
