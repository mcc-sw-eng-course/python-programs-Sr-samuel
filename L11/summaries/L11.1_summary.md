Ch. 2 - Testing Fundamentals
-----

### Basic Definitions 

- Errors
  - An error is a mistake, misconception, or misunderstanding on the part of a software developer.
- Faults (defects)
  - A fault (defect) is introduced into the software as the result of an error. It is an anomaly in the software that may cause it to behave incorrectly, and not according to its specification.
- Failures
  - A failure is the inability of a software system or component to perform its required functions within specified performance requirements
- Test Cases
  - A set of test inputs.
  - Execution conditions.
  - Expected outputs.
- Test
  - A test is a group of related test cases, or a group of related test cases and test procedures
- Test Oracle
  - A test oracle is a document, or piece of software that allows testers to determine whether a test has been passed or failed (I know it as a Test Report)
- Test bed
  - A test bed is an environment that contains all the hardware and software needed to test a software component or a software system
- Software Quality
  - Quality relates to the degree to which a system, system component, or process meets specified requirements
- Metric
  - A metric is a quantitative measure of the degree to which a system, system component, or process possesses a given attribute
- Quality Metrics
  - Correctness: Intended Function
  - Reliability: Expected functions under X amount of time
  - Usability: Effort to learn, operate, prepare input and interpret the output
  - Integrity: Withstand both intentional and accidental attacks
  - Portability: Transfer from one environment to another
  - Maintainability: Effort to make changes to the software
  - Interoperability: Effort to link/couple one system to another
- Software quality Assurance Group
  - Team of people with the necessary training and skills to ensure that all necessary actions are taken during the development process so that the resulting software conforms to established technical requirements.
- Review
  - A review is a group meeting whose purpose is to evaluate a software artifact or a set of software artifacts.

### Software testing principles

A principle is defined as:

1. a general or fundamental, law, doctrine, or assumption
2. a rule or code of conduct
3. the laws or facts of nature underlying the working of an artificial device

#### Principles of Software testing

1. Testing is the process of exercising a software component using a selected set of test cases, with the intent of revealing defects, and evaluating quality.
2. When the test objective is to detect defects, then a good test case is one that has a high robability of revealing a yet undetected defect(s).
3. Test results should be inspected meticulously.
4. A test case must contain the expected output or result.
5. Test cases should be developed for both valid and invalid input conditions.
6. The probability of the existence of additional defects in a software component is proportional to the number of defects already detected in that component.
7. Testing should be carried out by a group that is independent of the development group.
8. Tests must be repeatable and reusable.
9. Testing should be planned.
10. Testing activities should be integrated into the software life cycle.
11. Testing is a creative and challenging task

### Tester's Role in Software Development

The tester’s job is to reveal defects, find weak points, inconsistent behavior, and circumstances where the software does not work as expected.

Your goal as a tester is to work with the developers to produce high-quality software that meets the customers’ requirements.

Testers also need to work along side with requirements engineers to ensure that requirements are testable, and to plan for system and acceptance test.

Ch 3. Defects, Hypotheses, and Tests
-----

### Origins of Defects

Defects have detrimental affects on software users, and software engineers work very hard to produce high-quality software with a low number of defects.

Sources of Defects:

- Education: 
  - The software engineer did not have the proper educational background to prepare the software artifact.
- Communication:
  - The software engineer was not informed about something by a colleague.
- Oversight: 
  - The software engineer omitted to do something.
- Transcription: 
  - The software engineer knows what to do, but makes a mistake in doing it.
- Process:
  - The process used by the software engineer misdirected her actions.

Our goal as testers is to discover these defects preferably before the software is in operation.

Myers has a similar approach to testing. He describes the successful test as one that reveals the presence of a (hypothesized) defect. The Hypotheses are uses to:

- design test cases
- design test procedures
- assemble test sets
- select the testing levels (unit, integration, etc.) appropriate for the tests
- evaluate the results of the tests

A fault (defect) model can be described as a link between the error made (e.g., a missing requirement, a misunderstood design element, a typographical error), and the fault/defect in the software.


### Defect Classes, the Defect Repository , and Test Design

Requirement Defects:

1. Functional Description Defects: Overall description in incorrect
2. Feature Defects: Missing feature description.
3. Feature Interaction Defects: Incorrect description of interaction of the feature.
4. Interface Description Defects: Description of interface with external SW, HW and users.

Design Defects:

1. Algorithmic and Processing Defects: Pseudo-code of algorithm is incorrect.
2. Control, Logic, and Sequence: Logic flow in pseudo-code is wrong.
3. Data Defects: Incorrect design of data structures.
4. Module Interface Description Defects: Error using parameters (amount, type, ordering)
5. Functional Description Defects: Unclear design elements.
6. External Interface Description Defects: Incorrect descriptions.

Coding Defects:

1. Algorithmic and Processing Defects: Wrong implementation of an algorithm.
2. Control, Logic, and Sequence: Missing paths in the code.
3. Typographical Defects: Syntax errors.
4. Initialization Defects: Non Initialized data
5. Data-Flow Defects: Sequence of operation of the data incorrect
6. Data Defects: Incorrect implementation of data structures.
7. Module Interface Defects: Error using parameters (amount, type, ordering)
8. Code Documentation Defects: documentation does not reflect what the program actually does
9. External Hardware, Software Interfaces Defects

Testing Defects:

1. Test Harness Defects: Auxiliary code for tests is incorerect.
2. Test Case Design and Test Procedure Defects: incorrect, incomplete, missing, inappropriate test cases, and test procedures
