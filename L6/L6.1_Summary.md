The Essential Software Requirement
=====

Many software problems arise from shortcomings in the ways that people gather, document, agree on, and modify the product's requirements.

Most people wouldn't ask a construction contractor to build a custom $300,000 house without extensively discussing their needs and desires and refining the details progressively. However, people blithely gloss over the corresponding issues when it comes to software development. Errors made during the requirements stage account for 40 to 60 percent of all defects found in a software project.

Requirements are the foundation for both the software development and the project management activities. Handled well, can lead to exciting products, delighted customers, and fulfilled developers. Handled poorly, it's the source of misunderstanding, frustration, and friction that undermine the product's quality and business value.

Software Requirements Defined 
-----

One problem with the software industry is the lack of common definitions for terms we use to describe aspects of our work. A customer's definition of requirements might sound like a high-level product concept to the developer. The developer's notion of requirements might sound like detailed user interface design to the user.

A key concept is that the requirements **_must be_** documented.

### Interpretations of Requirements

Consultant Brian Lawrence suggests that a requirement is "anything that drives design choices"

The IEEE Standard Glossary of Software Engineering Terminology (1990) defines a requirement as:

1. A condition or capability needed by a user to solve a problem or achieve an objective.
2. A condition or capability that must be met or possessed by a system or system component to satisfy a contract, standard, specification, or other formally imposed document.
3. A documented representation of a condition or capability as in 1 or 2.

Karl E. Wiegers (Author of the book) thinks of a requirement as a property that a product must have to provide value to a stakeholder.

Sommerville and Sawyer 1997 say:
> Requirements areâ€¦a specification of what should be implemented. They are descriptions of how the system should behave, or of a system property or attribute. They may be a constraint on the development process of the system.

### Levels of Requirements

Software requirements include three distinct levels:

- Business requirements
  - Represent high-level objectives of the organization or customer who requests the system.
- User requirements
  - User requirements therefore describe what the user will be able to do with the system.
- Functional requirements.
  - specify the software functionality that the developers must build into the product to enable users to accomplish their tasks, thereby satisfying the business requirements. 

![Requirement Relationship](Relationship_Requirements.png "Requirement Relationship")

**Image: Relationship of several types of requirements information.**

*Business rules* include corporate policies, government regulations, industry standards, accounting practices, and computational algorithms. Sometimes business rules are the origin of specific quality attributes that are implemented in functionality. Therefore, you can trace the genesis of certain functional requirements back to a particular business rule.

Functional requirements are documented in a software requirements specification (SRS), which describes as fully as necessary the expected behavior of the software system.

The SRS additionally contains nonfunctional requirements, which includes performance goals and descriptions of quality attributes. *Quality attributes* augment the description of the product's functionality by describing the product's characteristics in various dimensions that are important either to users or to developers, like usability, portability, integrity, efficiency, and robustness. Other nonfunctional requirements describe external interfaces between the system and the outside world, and design and implementation constraints. *Constraints* impose restrictions on the choices available to the developer for design and construction of the product.

Product features, a *feature* is a set of logically related functional requirements that provides a capability to the user and enables the satisfaction of a business objective.

Example requirement for a **Word Processor**:

- **Business Requirement:** "The product will allow users to correct spelling errors in a document efficiently."
- **User Requirements:** "Find spelling errors", "Add word to global dictionary."
- **Functional Requirement:** The spell checker has many individual functional requirements, which deal with operations such as finding and highlighting a misspelled word, displaying a dialog box with suggested replacements, and globally replacing misspelled words with corrected words.
- **Nonfunctional requirements:** The quality attribute called usability would specify just what is meant by the word "efficiently" in the business requirement.

### What Requirements are not

Requirements specifications do not include design or implementation details (other than known constrains), project planning information, or testing information.

Requirements Development and Management
-----

### Development

We can subdivide it in elicitation, analysis, specification, and validation. It Encompass all the activities involved with gathering, evaluating, and documenting the requirements for a software or software-containing product.

Activities related to development:

- Identifying the product's expected user classes
- Eliciting needs from individuals who represent each user class
- Understanding user tasks and goals and the business objectives with which those tasks align
- Analyzing the information received from users to distinguish their task goals from functional requirements, nonfunctional requirements, business rules, suggested solutions, and extraneous information
- Allocating portions of the top-level requirements to software components defined in the system architecture
- Understanding the relative importance of quality attributes
- Negotiating implementation priorities
- Translating the collected user needs into written requirements specifications and models
- Reviewing the documented requirements to ensure a common understanding of the users' stated requirements and to correct any problems before the development group accepts them

**Iteration** is a key to requirements development success.

### Management

Entails "establishing and maintaining an agreement with the customer on the requirements for the software project".

Activities related to management:

- Defining the requirements baseline (a snapshot in time representing the currently agreed-upon body of requirements for a specific release)
- Reviewing proposed requirements changes and evaluating the likely impact of each change before approving it
- Incorporating approved requirements changes into the project in a controlled way
- Keeping project plans current with the requirements
- Negotiating new commitments based on the estimated impact of requirements changes
- Tracing individual requirements to their corresponding designs, source code, and test cases
- Tracking requirements status and change activity throughout the project

Every Project has Requirements
-----

Frederick Brooks eloquently stated : 
> The hardest single part of building a software system is deciding precisely what to build. No other part of the conceptual work is as difficult as establishing the detailed technical requirements, including all the interfaces to people, to machines, and to other software systems. No other part of the work so cripples the resulting system if done wrong. No other part is more difficult to rectify later.

Often, it's impossible to fully specify the requirements before commencing construction. In those cases, take an iterative and incremental approach to implement one portion of the requirements at a time, obtaining customer feedback before moving on to the next cycle. 

### No assumed Requirements

If you don't write down even the implicit and assumed requirements, don't be surprised if the software doesn't meet user expectations. Periodically ask, "What are we assuming?" to try to surface those hidden thoughts. If you come across an assumption during requirements discussions, write it down and confirm its accuracy. If you're developing a replacement system, review the previous system features to determine whether they're required in the replacement rather than assuming that they are or are not.

When Bad Requirements Happen to Nice People
-----

The major consequence of requirements problems is rework doing over something that you thought was already done. Rework can consume 30 to 50 percent of your total development cost, and requirements errors account for 70 to 85 percent of the rework cost.

Shortcomings in requirements practices pose many risks to project success, where success means delivering a product that satisfies the user's functional and quality expectations at agreed-on cost and schedule.

Common requirements risks:

- Insufficient User Involvement
