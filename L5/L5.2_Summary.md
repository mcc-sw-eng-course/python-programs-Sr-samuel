Lifecycle Planning
=====

Every Software development goes through a lifecycle, it establishes the order in which projects specifies, 
prototypes, designs, implements, reviews, tests and performs it's activities.

Choosing the correct lifecycle model can improve development speed among other things, in the same manner choosing the wrong lifecycle can be a reason for slow development and frustration among other things.

Pure Waterfall
-----
A project progress through an orderly sequence of steps from the initial software concept through system testing. The project holds a review and the end of each phase to determine if it's ready to advance to the next phase.

It works well for projects that are well understood but complex, since we can benefit from tackling complexity in an orderly way.

It allows to do all the planning up front, and does not provide tangible results of software until the end of the lifecycle.

A disadvantage is that it's not flexible, since it's very difficult of fully specifying the requirements at the beginning of the project.

It is poorly suited for rapid-development projects.

Code-and-Fix
-----
You start with a general idea of what you want to build.  You might have a formal specification, or you might not. You then use whatever combination of informal design, code, debug, and test methodologies suits you until you have a product that's ready to release.

It's simple because it add no overhead, no docs, no quality, just code. If you can code, you can use it, no previous experience needed.

Useful for small proof of concept programs, throwaway prototypes or short lived demos, other kind of project this is dangerous, since is difficult to recover from a design problem.

Spiral
-----
Breaks a software project up into miniprojects, and each miniproject addresses one or more major risks until all risks have been addressed.

The basic idea is that you start small, and iterate from there. Each iteration involves 6 steps:

* Determine objectives, alternatives and constrains
* Identify and resolve risks
* Evaluate alternatives
* Develop the deliveries for that iteration, and verify that they are correct
* Plan the  next iteration
* Commit to an approach for the next iteration (if you decide to have one).

An important advantage is that as cost increases, the risks decreases. A disadvantage is that it's complicated, it's difficult to define objectives, verifiable milestones that indicate you are ready for the next iteration.

Modified Waterfalls
-----

### Sashimi (Waterfall with overlapping Phases)
The traditional waterfall model allows for minimal overlapping between phases at the enf od phase review. This model allows for a stronger degree of overlap, for example it suggesting that you might be well into architectural design and perhaps partway into detailed design before you consider requirement analysis complete.

A disadvantage is that it become difficult to track progress accurately, doing activities in parallel can cause miscommunication and inefficiency.

### Waterfall with Subprojects
Why delay the implementation of the areas that are easy to design just because we're waiting for the design of a difficult area? If the architecture has broken the system into logically independent subsystems, you can
spin off separate projects, each of which can proceed at its own pace.

### Waterfall with Risk Reduction
This models puts a risk-reduction spiral at the top of the waterfall to address the requirements risk. It allow to develop a user-interface prototype or any other requirement-gathering practice to fully understand the requirement.

Evolutionary Prototyping
-----
It allows to develop the system concept as you move to the project. You begin with a mos viable aspect, demonstrate that to the customer and then continue to develop again with the feedback received. At some point both parties agree that the prototype is "good enough", and then work on the remaining task to release the prototype as the final product.

It's useful when requirements are changing rapidly, or when developers are unsure of the optimal architecture or algorithms to use.

A drawbacks for this model it's impossible to know how long it will take to create an acceptable product, and it can easily become an excuse to do code-and-fix development.

Staged Delivery (Incremental Implementation)
-----
You are able to show software to the customer in successively refined stages, a difference from the evolutionary prototype is that you know exactly what you are going to build when you set out to build.

The primary advantage of staged delivery is that it allows you to put useful functionality into the hands of your customers earlier.

The disadvantage is that it won't work without careful planning at both management and technical level. Management to be sure that the stages are meaningful to the customer, technical be sure to account all dependencies between different components. (i.e. Defer implementation of B to stage 4, then realizing at stage 2 that it's needed)

Design-to-schedule
-----
Similar to staged delivery, the difference is that you don't necessarily know at the outset that you'll make it to the last release. You might have 5 stages, but you make it only to the third)

It viable for when you have a product release by a particular date, or must have functioning software for a show. For example, The Microsoft Windows operating system includes several "applets," including WordPad, Paint, and Hearts. Microsoft might use design-to-schedule for those applets to keep them from delaying Windows overall.

Evolutionary Delivery
-----
Middle ground between Evolutionary Prototyping and staged delivery. You develop a version, show it to the customer and refine based on the feedback.

In evolutionary prototyping, your initial emphasis is on the visible aspects of the system; you go back later and plug up holes in the system's foundation. In evolutionary delivery, your initial emphasis is on the core of the system, which consists of lower level system functions that are unlikely to be changed by customer feedback.

Design-to-tools
-----
Is a radical approach that historically has been used only within exceptionally time-sensitive environments. The idea behind the design-to-tools model is that you put a capability into your product only if it's directly supported by existing software tools. If it isn't supported, you leave it out. By "tools," I mean code and class libraries, code
generators, rapid-development languages, and other software tools that dramatically reduce implementation time.

Is inevitably that you won't be able to implement all the functionality you ideally would like to include. But if you choose your tools carefully, you can implement most of the functionality you would like.

The design-to-tools model has a few main disadvantages. You lose a lot of control over your product. You become more dependent on commercial software producers.

Useful when writing small, mostly disposable programs.

Commercial Off-the-Shelf Software
-----
Buy software off the shelf.

When you actually build your own software, you have to make design, cost, and schedule concessions, and the actual custom-built product will fall short of the ideal you envisioned. If you were to deliver only 75 percent of the ideal product, how would that compare to the off-the-shelf software?

Choosing the Most Rapid Lifecycle for your project
-----
Different projects have different needs, even if they all need to be developed as quickly as possible. 

The best lifecycle model for any particular project depends on that project's needs.

The following question might can be answered depending on the project needs:

* How well do my customer and I understand the requirements at the beginning of the project?
* How well do I understand the system architecture?
* How much reliability do I need?
* How much do I need to plan ahead and design ahead during this project for future versions?
* Do I need to be able to make midcourse corrections?
* Do I need to provide my customers with visible progress throughout the project?
* Do I need to provide management with visible progress throughout the project?
* How much sophistication do I need to use this lifecycle model successfully?

After answering the questions at taking a look at the Advantages and disadvantages of each lifecycle model, it will help in the decision to select the model.

In general, the more closely you can stick to a linear, waterfall-like approach—and do it effectively—the more rapid your development will be.
