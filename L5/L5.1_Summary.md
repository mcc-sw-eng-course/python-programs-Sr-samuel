L5.1 Summary Rapid Development Ch 11- 13
======

In the book "Rapid Development" chapter 11 to 13 the author Steve Mcconnell writes about developer motivation, how to motivate and how to kill the motivation. He also talks about Team Work, and the importance of team work and why a team fails, and introduces the concept of high performance team. Finally he talks about team structure and different team models and different considerations for when forming a team. 

Motivation
=====
When pursuing Rapid Development, People is the biggest potential to shorten schedules, and motivation is the single greatest influence on how people perform.

People if motivated by different factors, and the leaders must find how each person is motivated in order to make the project successful.

Top 5 Motivators
-----

- Achievements
  - Developers must Own the product and the goals, people will work harder to achieve their own goals that someone else's. Also setting goals that are clear will help with achievement. 
- Possibility of Growth
  - Work in new technologies, developers like to keep learning.
- Work Itself
  - Allow people to work, create an environment for them to work.
- Personal Life
  - Schedule a project realistically to allow for personal life.
- Technical Supervision Opportunity
  - Create opportunities for technical lead positions
- Rewards and incentives 
- Possibility to work in Pilot projects 

Morale Killers
-----

- Hygiene factors
  - The Basic conditions needed for developers (I.e. AC, Lighting, PC, Tools, reference books, etc).
- Manager decisions
  - Manipulation. When a project is really needed, but no more resources can be assigned. Developers can detect in many cases the ambitious plans.
- Lack of appreciation
- Not involving developers in decisions

Team Work
======
Software uses team work extensively, many task are benefit from two brains rather than one (I.e. Review Req., Develop Architecture, etc)

Researchers found that the best team is up 4x as productive as the worst, it's important to pursuit a cohesion in the team structure.

Characteristics of a High Performance team (teams that are highly cohesive):

- Shared vision and goals 
- Team identity 
- Result-driven structure  
  - roles must be clear 
- Competent team members  
  - team chosen based on the needs 
- Commitment to the team  
  - we rather than I 
- Mutual trust 
  - Honesty 
  - Openness 
  - Consistency 
  - Respect 
- Effective communication 
  - Everyone understands when they speak 
- Sense of Autonomy 
  - Do whatever necessary without interference 
- Sense of Empowerment 
  - Take action 
- Small team size 
  - 8-10 people

Why team fails?
-----
- Lack of common vision 
  - You have to do the best word processor, but in 3 months 
- Lack of identity 
  - They donâ€™t play the role, members want to work alone. 
- Lack of recognition 
- Ineffective communication 
- Lack of trust 
- Long term team building 
  - Keep a group if it jells into a team or disband it. 

Guidelines for a Team
-----

As a team leader, I will:

1. Avoid compromising the team's objective with political issues.
2. Exhibit personal commitment to the team's goal.
3. Not dilute the team's efforts with too many priorities.
4. Be fair and impartial toward all team members.

6. Be open to new ideas and information from team members.

**Team Members**

As a team member, I will:

1. Demonstrate a realistic understanding of my role and accountabilities.
2. Demonstrate objective and factbased judgments.
3. Collaborate effectively with other team members.
4. Make the team goal a higher priority than any personal objective.

10. Demonstrate courage of conviction by directly confronting important issues.
11. Demonstrate leadership in ways that contribute to the team's success.
12. Respond constructively to feedback from others.

Team Structure
=====
Even when you have skilled, motivated, hard-working people, the wrong team structure can undercut their efforts instead of catapulting them to success.

Considerations
----
The first consideration when organizing a team is to determine the team objective, then a structure that matches the objectives must be selected.

Kind of teams:

- Problem resolution
  - Focuses on solving a complex, poorly defined problem
  - Feature: Trust
  - Example: Corrective maintenance on live systems
  - Process: Focus on issues
  - Lifecycle model: Code-and-fix, spiral
  - Selection criteria: Intelligent, street smart, people sensitive, high integrity
- Creativity
  - Explore possibilities and alternatives
  - Feature: Autonomy
  - Example: New product development
  - Process: Explore possibilities and alternatives
  - Lifecycle model: Evolutionary prototyping, evolutionary delivery, spiral, design-to-schedule, design-to-tools
  - Selection criteria: Cerebral, independent, thinkers, self-starters, tenacious
- Tactical Execution
  - Focuses on carrying out a well-defined plan.
  - Feature: Clarity
  - Example: Product upgrade development
  - Process: Highly focused tasks with clear roles, often marked by clear success or failure
  - Lifecycle model: Waterfall, modified waterfalls, staged delivery, spiral, design-to-schedule, design-to-tools
  - Selection criteria: Loyal, committed, action-oriented, sense of urgency, responsive

Team Models
-----

- Business team
  - Most common group headed by a technical lead
- Chief-Programmer team
  - Surgical team concept, Surgeon handles the design and code. Backup programer critic and research assistance and back up surgeon
  - Administrator handles all the administrative work
  - toolsmith responsible for creating tools
  - language lawyer answers esoteric questions about the programming language
  - Many roles are regularly performed by non programmers
  - Is appropriate for creative projects, in which having one mind at the top will help to protect the system's conceptual integrity.
- Skunkworks Team
  - A skunkworks project takes a group of talented, creative product developers, puts them in a facility where they will be freed of the organization's normal bureaucratic restrictions, and turns them loose to develop and innovate. The management doesn't want to know the details of how they do their job; they just want to know that they're doing it. The team is thus free to organize itself as it sees fit.
  - Is appropriate for exploratory projects on which creativity is all-important.
- Feature Team
  - Development, quality assurance, documentation, program management, and marketing personnel are arranged in traditional hierarchical reporting structures.
  - The team has empowerment and accountability.
  - Is appropriate for problem-resolution projects because they have the empowerment and accountability needed to resolve issues expediently
- Search-and-Rescue Team
  - Focuses on solving a specific problem
  - Is appropriate for teams that need to focus on problem resolution.
- SWAT Team
  - Group of people who are highly skilled with a particular tool or practice and turn them loose on a problem that is well suited to being solved by that tool or practice
  - Appropriate on tactical-execution projects (not to be creative but to implement a solution within the limits of a tool or a practice)
- Professional Athletic Team
  - Athletic teams also have highly specialized roles.
  - Applies best to tactical-execution projects, which emphasize the highly specialized roles that individual players play.
- Theater Team
  - Is characterized by strong direction and a lot of negotiation about project roles.
  - Individual contributors can shape their roles, their parts of the project, as their own artistic instincts move them.
  - In the theater model, you are not just assigned to a project. You audition, and then you accept a role.
  - Appropriate for software teams that are dominated by strong personalities.

Managers and technical leads
------
On a lot of team projects, there are two or three regular developers and one developer who has some management responsibilities. This is usually called "Lead" ot "Technical Lead"

The technical lead is responsible for the technical work and is responsible for a single team. The manager is responsible for the nontechnical direction of the team and is responsible for two or more projects. From the team's point of view, the manager's role is to unburden the technical lead by handling certain nontechnical tasks. From the organization's point of view, the manager's role is to control the team so that it conforms to the goals of the organization.
