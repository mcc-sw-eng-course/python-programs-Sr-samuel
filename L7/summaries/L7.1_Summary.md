UML Distilled
======

In the book "UML Distilled" chapter 3, 4, 5 and 10 the author Martin Fowlers writes some guidelines and recommendations on how to design Class, Sequence and State Machine Diagrams.

3.- Class Diagrams: The Essentials
-----

A class diagram describes de the types of objects in the system and the various kind of static relationships that exists among them.

- Properties: Corresponding to fields in a Class 
  - Attributes:  Line of text within the class box itself
  - Associations: Solid line between two classes

- Multiplicity: how many objects may fill the property.
  - 1 Exactly one
  - 0..1 May on May not have
  - \* No Upper Limit

- Bi-Directional Associations: A pair of properties that are linked together as inverses.

- Operations:  Correspond to the methods on a class.

- Generalization: Inheritance

- Notes and Comments

- Dependency: Exists between two elements if changes to the definition of one element may cause changes to the other.
- Constraint Rules: The UML allows you to use anything to describe constraints. The only rule is that you put them inside braces ({}).

4.- Sequence Diagrams
-----

Interaction diagrams describe how groups of objects collaborate in some behavior. A sequence diagram captures the behavior of a single scenario. The diagram shows a number of example objects and the messages that are passed between these objects within the use case .

Sequence diagrams are good at showing collaborations among the objects; they are not so good at precise definition of the behavior.

5.- Class Diagrams: Advanced Concepts
-----

- Responsibilities: Comment string in the component. (Try to avoid, can't cause confusion)

- Static Operations and attributes: Static features are underlined an a class diagram. (equivalent to static members in C-based languages.)

- Aggregation: Is the part-of relationship. It's like saying that a car has an engine and wheels as its parts. Aggregation is strictly meaningless: Try to avoid.

- Composition: An instance of Point may be part of a polygon or may be the center of a circle, but it cannot be both;

- Derived Properties: Calculated based an other values.

- Abstract Class:  Cannot be directly instantiated.

- Interfaces and Abstract Classes: An interface is a class that has no implementation; that is, all its features are abstract.

- Read-Only: a property that can only be read by clients and that cannot be updated.

- Frozen: if it can-not change during the lifetime of an object; such properties are often called immutable. (deprecated but can still be used)

- Multiple and Dynamic Classification: An object may be described by several types that are not necessarily connected by inheritance. (a person sub-typed as either man or woman, doctor or
nurse, patient or not)

- Association Class: Association classes allow you to add attributes, operations, and other features
to associations. (We need to keep information about how awake that person was on a meeting; we can do this by adding the attribute attentiveness to the association)

- Template (Parameterized) Class: The «bind» keyword is a stereotype an the refinement relationship.

- Enumeration:  They are shown as the class which the «enumeration» keyword.

- Active Class: Has instances, each of which executes and controls its own thread of control.

- Visibility: Public (+), Private (-), Protected (#)

- Messages: Arrows are labeled which the messages that one object sends to another.

10.- State Machine Diagrams
-----

State machine diagrams are a familiar technique to describe the behavior of a System. Has an initial and final state and transition between the different states.

- Internal Activities: Transition that loops back to the same state.

- Activity State:  The ongoing activity is marked with the do/; hence the term do-activity.

- Superstates: Several states share common transitions and internal activities.

- Concurrent States: States can run in parallel

- Implementing State Diagrams: Can be done with nested switches, State pattern or State Tables.
