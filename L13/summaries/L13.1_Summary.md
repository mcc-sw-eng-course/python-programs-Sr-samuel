Continuous Integration
=====

A build may consist of the compilation, testing, inspection and deployment. Acts as a process for putting source code together and verifying that the software as a cohesive unit.

Steps of a CI scenario:

1. Developers commits the code to the Version Control Repository.
2. The CI detects the change, retrieves the latest copy of the code and executes the build script.
3. The CI server generates feedback by e-mailing build results.
4. The CI continues to poll for changes.

On objective of the CI is to find problems earlier by building often.

Elements required for CI:

1. A connection to a version control repository.
2. A build Script.
3. Some sort of feedback mechanism (such as email).
4. A process for integrating the source code changes (manual or CI server).

Features of the CI:

1. Source code compilation.
2. Database integration.
3. Testing.
4. Inspection (Static, dynamic analysis of code).
5. Deployment.
6. Documentation and feedback.

CI Practices:

| Practice | Description |
|:---------|:------------|
| Commit Code Frequently | Commit code to the VCS at least once a day |
| Don't commit broken code | Don't commit code that does not compile with other code or fails a test |
| Fix broken builds immediately | Developer who recently committed code must be involved in fixing the failed build |
| Write automated tests | Verify that the software works. Run tests with the CI |
| Akk test and inspection must pass | **All** test must pass prior to committing the code to the VCS |
| Run private builds | Build locally , to prevent integration failures |
| Avoid getting broken code | If the build failed. Wait for the developer to fix the build, or help him. Getting broken code makes you lose time |


Risks that CI prevents: 

| Risk | Mitigation |
|:-----|:-----------|
| Lack of deployable software | Use CI to deploy SW at any time. Create a build process that takes everything from the VCS |
| Late discovery of defects | Run builds that include developers tests with every change, so you can discover defects earlier in the SW cycle |
| Lack of project visibility | Know the health of your SW at all times by running builds regularly |
| Low-quality SW | Run test and inspections at every change so you can discover potential defects that may be introduced |
